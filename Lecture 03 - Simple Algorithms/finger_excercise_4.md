### Q13 True or False? The internal representation of the decimal number 1/10 = 0.1 requires an infinite number of digits.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

### Q4) After many computations, you get two floating numbers stored in variables a and b. Your code compares the numbers with a == b.

- [x] Doing the comparison will sometimes lead to a correct program.
- [ ] Doing the comparison will never lead to a correct program.
