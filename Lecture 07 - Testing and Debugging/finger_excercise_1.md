## Consider the following code specification:

```py
def size(aSet):
   """
   aSet is a collection of objects, which might be empty.
   Objects are assumed to be of the same type.
   """
```

### Here is a set of possible test cases to include in a black box test suite. Indicate which of the following conditions would make a good black box test suite for the function size by clicking on the appropriate choice(s).


- [x] Empty set
- [x] Set of size 1
- [ ] Set of odd size
- [ ] Set of even size
- [x] Set of size greater than 1
- [ ] Set whose size is a prime number
