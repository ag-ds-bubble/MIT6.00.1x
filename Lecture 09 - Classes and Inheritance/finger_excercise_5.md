## Consider the following code from the last lecture video:

```py
class intSet(object):
    """An intSet is a set of integers
    The value is represented by a list of ints, self.vals.
    Each int in the set occurs in self.vals exactly once."""

    def __init__(self):
        """Create an empty set of integers"""
        self.vals = []

    def insert(self, e):
        """Assumes e is an integer and inserts e into self""" 
        if not e in self.vals:
            self.vals.append(e)

    def member(self, e):
        """Assumes e is an integer
           Returns True if e is in self, and False otherwise"""
        return e in self.vals

    def remove(self, e):
        """Assumes e is an integer and removes e from self
           Raises ValueError if e is not in self"""
        try:
            self.vals.remove(e)
        except:
            raise ValueError(str(e) + ' not found')

    def __str__(self):
        """Returns a string representation of self"""
        self.vals.sort()
        return '{' + ','.join([str(e) for e in self.vals]) + '}'
```

### Your task is to define the following two methods for the intSet class:
### Define an intersect method that returns a new intSet containing elements that appear in both sets. In other words,
```py
s1.intersect(s2)
```
### would return a new intSet of integers that appear in both s1 and s2. Think carefully - what should happen if s1 and s2 have no elements in common?
### Add the appropriate method(s) so that len(s) returns the number of elements in s.

```py
class intSet(object):
    """An intSet is a set of integers
    The value is represented by a list of ints, self.vals.
    Each int in the set occurs in self.vals exactly once."""

    def __init__(self):
        """Create an empty set of integers"""
        self.vals = []

    def insert(self, e):
        """Assumes e is an integer and inserts e into self""" 
        if not e in self.vals:
            self.vals.append(e)

    def member(self, e):
        """Assumes e is an integer
           Returns True if e is in self, and False otherwise"""
        return e in self.vals

    def remove(self, e):
        """Assumes e is an integer and removes e from self
           Raises ValueError if e is not in self"""
        try:
            self.vals.remove(e)
        except:
            raise ValueError(str(e) + ' not found')
    
    def intersect(self, set2):
        _ret = [k for k in self.vals if k in set2.vals]
        _ret = sorted(_ret)
        _ret = [str(k) for k in _ret]
        _ret = "{"+",".join(_ret)+"}"
        return _ret
        
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.vals)
            
    def __str__(self):
        """Returns a string representation of self"""
        self.vals.sort()
        return '{' + ','.join([str(e) for e in self.vals]) + '}'
