### For each of the following expressions, indicate the value that prints out when the expression is evaluated. If the evaluation would lead to an error, write the word 'error'; if nothing would print out, write the word 'blank'.

### While you could simply type these expressions into your IDE, we encourage you to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of basic Python expressions.

### If the temperatures seem weird to you, like most of the world, you probably use the Celsius system. We Americans still use the crazy Fahrenheit system...

```py
if 6 > 7:
   print("Yep")
```

```py
var = 'Panda'
if var == "panda":
