### For each of the following expressions, indicate the value returned, or if the evaluation would lead to an error, write the word 'error' (note this is a word, not a string, no quotes). While you could simply type these expressions into your IDE, we encourage you to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of basic Python expressions.

### Q1) "a" + "bc"
> abc

### Q2) 3 * "bc"
> bcbcbc

### Q3) "3" * "bc"
> error

### Q4) "abcd"[2]
> c

### Q5) "abcd"[0:2]
> ab

### Q6) "abcd"[:2]

### Q7) "abcd"[2:]
